#  Minimal API

## Description:
The Minimal API project is designed to develop a lightweight and versatile API using minimal code. In the current era where Microservices architecture is on the rise, the need for lean services with minimal code overhead is essential. This project leverages Microsoft's ability to create APIs with very little code, without even having to split the code into separate files.

## Properties:
- Enables rapid development of API interfaces without unnecessary code complexity.
- Perfect for projects where a lean and efficient service is required.
- Uses Microsoft tools for efficient API development.

## Code Example:
    app.MapPost("/tasks", async (ToDoDbContext context, Item item) =>
     {
     context.Items.Add(item);
     await context.SaveChangesAsync();
     return Results.Created($"/tasks/{item.Id}", item);
    });
